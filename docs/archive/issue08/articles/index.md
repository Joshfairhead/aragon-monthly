## **Columns**
> A column is a recurring piece or article in the newspaper where a writer expresses their own opinion in few columns allotted to them by the newspaper organisation.

> Columns are written by columnists who are dedicated to contribute quality content for an extended time, usually on the same subject area or theme each time – that typically contains the author's opinion or point of view.
