Whether your digital identity comprises a mugshot or a 256 bit hexadecimal address, validation and verification are still a requisite. Even on the decentralized, pseudonymous web, in which real world identities are optional, reputation still counts. The web 3.0 isn\u2019t about concealing everyone under a cloak of invisibility; rather it\u2019s about giving individuals the right to privacy. The freedom to choose which data they disclose to which platforms, rather than having it hoovered up by every app they install and website they join, to be stored in centralized silos that are a honeypot to hackers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can Aragon create a fairer world?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion pieces\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nZurpples / @Zurpples\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuddenly it\u2019s 2020.

A DAICO contract is published by a single development team that wishes to raise funds for a project. The DAICO contract starts off in \u201ccontribution mode\u201d, specifying a mechanism by which anyone can contribute ETH to the contract, and get tokens in exchange.

The team at Placeholder has years of experience in evaluating crypto projects and teams, and we are very proud to have their expertise onboard. The goal of the program is to attract talent to research and build the necessary tooling for developing solutions around Aragon and Ethereum.\n\n\nIn which I argue that \u201ctightly coupled\u201d on-chain voting is overrated, the status quo of \u201cinformal governance\u201d as practiced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Zcash and similar systems is much less bad than commonly thought, that people who think that the purpose of blockchains is to completely expunge soft mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic governance (emphasis on \u201ccompletely\u201d) are absolutely crazy, and loosely coupled voting as done by Carbonvotes and similar systems is underrated, as well as describe what framework should be used when thinking about blockchain governance in the first place.\n\n\nA fully decentralized peer-to-peer lending marketplace.\n district0x is thrilled to announce our partnership with Bloom to create a fully decentralized lending marketplace, the Bloom Lending District. This district will offer a standardized, transparent, peer-to-peer method for requesting and funding loans, allowing anyone with access to the internet to lend and borrow funds free of central influence. There will be no middlemen, no fees, no cross border limitations, and no constraints and will not require access to the traditional financial system\u200a\u2014\u200atruly unleashing the power of Ethereum.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon Team Update: December 2017\n\n\nKeeps on the district0x Network\n\n\nAuctus to leverage Aragon to become a truly decentralized platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon\n\n\ndistrict0x\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nTatu K\u00e4rki\n on Jan 3\n\n\nAuthor \nAlexander Khoriaty\n on Jan 4\n\n\nAuthor \nLudmila Lopes\n on Jan 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWritten reviews of what the team members have been up to.\n Team members will produce a write-up of the most important things they have worked on since last Community Meeting, the problems they have found and what they plan to do in the next weeks (that can be a bit blurry, and that\u2019s fine). These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\nBringing private data to user-governed marketplaces.\n At district0x, we have thus far largely avoided this issue by building marketplaces which rely mostly on already public cryptographic data (Name Bazaar), or relatively static information users are already comfortable making public (like freelancer or employer profiles on Ethlance). Where we\u2019ve had to protect private data for supporting services within districts, we\u2019ve done so with purpose-built solutions.\n\n\nAuctus announces their plans to use and integrate with Aragon.\n By deploying Auctus on the Aragon Network, it will be possible to protect Auctus and it\u2019s community from any intermediary trying to abuse its power. Furthermore, it will avoid misunderstandings between agents, keeping full record of all decision making and financial decisions. It will also allow Auctus to become truly community driven, increasing the number of stakeholders, as well as decentralizing decision making and operational processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon Q4 Development Update\n\n\nAragon Q4 Transparency Report\n\n\nAn Introduction to district0x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragon\n\n\nAragon\n\n\ndistrict0x\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nJorge Izquierdo\n on Jan 11\n\n\nAuthor \nTatu K\u00e4rki\n on Jan 17\n\n\nAuthor \nMatt Breen\n on Jan 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgress of development from the last quarter of 2017.\n In the last quarter of 2017 we were heads down developing everything for the version 0.5 release of the Aragon Core app. Lots of progress was made, first audit of the smart contracts was conducted with good results and we\u2019re on track to get the testnet release out really soon\u2122.

Once the contribution period ends, the ability to contribute ETH stops, and the initial token balances are set; from there on the tokens can become tradeable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotes on Blockchain Governance\n\n\nWe are proud to announce the start of P2P Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDAOs\n\n\nDAOs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nVitalik Buterin\n on Dec 17\n\n\nAuthor unknown on Jan 31\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn which I argue that \u201ctightly coupled\u201d on-chain voting is overrated, the status quo of \u201cinformal governance\u201d as practiced by Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, Zcash and similar systems is much less bad than commonly thought, that people who think that the purpose of blockchains is to completely expunge soft mushy human intuitions and feelings in favor of completely algorithmic governance (emphasis on \u201ccompletely\u201d) are absolutely crazy, and loosely coupled voting as done by Carbonvotes and similar systems is underrated, as well as describe what framework should be used when thinking about blockchain governance in the first place.\n\n\nP2P Models is a \u20ac1.5M 5-year ERC research project to build decentralized, democratic, and sustainable Collaborative Economy organizations.\n The Collaborative Economy is rapidly expanding, but it is dominated by centralized web platforms which hold user data and concentrate all decision-making power and profits. The idea of the P2P Models project is to tackle these issues, replacing the centralized web platform with DAOs on the blockchain, so we reduce the difference of power between the \"infrastructure owner\" and the user community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nSubmit News!",

Let\u2019s dive in\u2026\n\n\nOur Vision\n\n\nEverything we\u2019re building is to challenge the current ownership structures of our world\u2019s communities and marketplaces. We work together everyday to lower the bar of entry so anyone can do this as well.\n\n\nWe believe there is a better world within grasp and \nwe value\n the visions of the people that think differently about our future. With each new partnership and community member we\u2019re building a network effect that will move us forward to these shared goals.\n\n\nHow Will We Achieve This?\n\n\nWith each development, we\u2019re progressively building what we call d0xINFRA, a standard framework that will power the underlying network. We\u2019re building d0xINFRA by utilizing already established curation market models like a \u2018\nToken Curated Registry\n\u2019 within our \nDistrict Registry\n, utilizing distributed marketplace concepts (\nUber\n, \nUpwork\n, and \nAirb\nb\n) and allowing for open modular governance models by using \nAragon\n.\n\n\nEach district we launch will be a core component of d0xINFRA:\n\n\n\n\nEthlance\n - Search, filtering, posting, listing, ranking and reputation\n\n\nName Bazaar\n - Core framework/contracts for the d0xINFRA network\n\n\nMeme Factory\n - Curation functions, community functions, will be one of the first district registries, and will decentralize a crypto-collectible model that currently operates successfully with centralized parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Staking Interface\n\n\nAfter the Aragon mainnet launch, we will deploy a staking interface that allows DNT holders to participate in open control over the districts through an Aragon governance layer for each of the markets that come online. When a district is created, an Aragon entity will also be created that people can interact with through the staking mechanism. After staking you will receive voting rights in that district.\n\n\nWhat is the District Creation Interface?\n\n\nThe creation interface can be described as the WordPress of dApps, the districts we\u2019re launching are like wordpress templates, while auxiliary modules can be seen as WordPress plugins to extend functionality. This will all come together after the core d0xINFRA framework is online. This will dramatically lower the bar of entry for anyone wanting to remove central power structures from any marketplace they can dream up, even if they aren\u2019t a developer.\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nAragon will be utilized as a governance layer and enable the ability to stake DNT to districts. It will also allow us to start building out district-specific governance functions. People will stake DNT in those varying governance models.\n\n\nSome governance models that we will likely see:\n\n\n\n\nTime based staking\n\n\nStake weighted\n\n\nMeritocracy and reputation hybrids\n\n\nFutarchy\n\n\nLiquid democracy or delegate style governance\n\n\n\n\nWhen you stake DNT to a district you will be granted access to the Aragon entity\u2019s voting rights. Considering the modular nature of Aragon, the benefit of staking will be different depending on the individual district.\n\n\nExamples of things that governance participants could potentially control:\n\n\n\n\nMonetization\n\n\nDistrict design\n\n\nGovernance structure\n\n\nBylaws\n\n\nAuxiliary modules utilized\n\n\nUtilization of fees and development funding\n\n\nReputation systems\n\n\nDevelopment roadmaps\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nThe end result will be a world where you can create a market that suits your needs, where market participants have the say as much as anyone else and no central power structure can dictate how the market works. We want anyone in the world to have access to the benefits that decentralization brings. The district0x network is yours and we can\u2019t wait to see what you build.\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\nFor more information about the \ndistrict0x Network\n:\n- Check out our \nwhite paper\n\n- Watch our \nintroduction video\n\n- Subscribe for \nemail updates\n\n- Follow us on \nTwitter\n\n- Join us on \nTelegram\n\n- Subscribe to our \nsubreddit\n\n- See our \nlive stream recordings\n on YouTube",

            "text": "Thoughts On Governance and Network Effects\n\n\nAuthor \nLuke Duncan / @lkngtn\n\n\nThis article was originally posted in the \nAragon Blog\n on Dec 12 2017\n\n\n\n\nThis post discusses \ngovernance\n and its impact on \nnetwork effects\n and why both relate to how value flows and is captured within tokenized blockchain networks.\n\n\nHardware, Software, and Data are commoditized by decentralization\n\n\nThe process of commoditization turns a good or service which is highly differentiated or even unique into a fungible resource, where differences between the commodity offered by sellers in a market are low. Commoditized markets are associated with declining prices and narrow profit margins, as competitors struggle to differentiate their offerings and instead rely on price-based competition.\n\n\n\n\nHardware\n: \nEthereum\n lets you pay for computation and storage on an as-needed basis by paying gas. Projects like \nGolem\n, \nStorj\n, \nTruebit\n, and others aim to further commoditize hardware through decentralized networks. Products that build on these technologies cannot rely on specialized hardware as a key differentiator.\n\n\nSoftware\n: Open source software is commoditized, there is no difference between one instance of public code versus another instance of the same code. Since the only applications that make sense to run on a blockchain are those that benefit from trust-minimization, public source code is the standard.\n\n\nData\n: Decentralized applications rely on publicly available data sources, otherwise there is no way for the public to validate transactions. Privacy technology such as \nzk-Snarks\n may obscure public visibility, but the encrypted dataset that enables a shared state remains public.\n\n\n\n\nProducts or services offered in a market like this will either compete on price, quickly driving profit margins down or seek out new ways to differentiate themselves.\n\n\nOne way to differentiate is to issue a token\n, even if you don\u2019t otherwise need one. Having a token allows you to create a network effect around your product, people who hold this token will have a vested interest and prefer your product over alternatives. They will be your biggest advocates, they will shill your product to all their friends, who will jump on the band wagon, and do the same to their friends\u2026 and on and on. Or maybe not\u2026\n\n\nIf the market is commoditized and your competitors have at best an equivalent product to yours, issuing a token and requiring it to be used in order to access your product works (sort of like an \nAPI key\n). However, by forcing the use of a token when your application doesn\u2019t require one you create a worse user experience because the user\u2019s effective cost is unpredictable. Now if a competitor offers the same product without the restriction, it isn\u2019t equivalent, it is objectively better. Therefore, differentiation in this way may work to some degree, but is not particularly defensible.\n\n\nDefensible tokenization\n\n\nIn a \ndefensible token model\n you cannot remove the token or replace it with a different token and create a better user experience.\n\n\nTo help reason about the \ndefensibility\n of different tokenization models, identifying a baseline that all defensible token models have in common is helpful:\n\n\n\n\nA\n: Fees are justified for \nservices provided\n. The execution of arbitrary smart-contract code does not justify paying fees in excess of the gas used to validate/mine transactions.\n\n\nB\n: It is not defensible to force the usage of a token in such a way that the application would work \nequally well or better using a different token\n. (e.g. a stable coin, or ETH)\n\n\nC\n: Tokens which are uniquely \nrequired\n to incentivize or disincentivize behavior in order \nto provide a service\n accrue value relative to that services utility.\n\n\n\n\nIf we agree on these statements we can immediately throw out many tokenization strategies. For example \na token whose primary utility is to be the exclusive\n \nmedium of exchange\n for transactions within a network violates all three of these statements. \n[A]\n because having to convert to the native token is an \narbitrary fee\n unrelated to a service. \n[B]\n because in a market that requires a medium of exchange, a stable token that \neveryone already has\n works far better than the application\u2019s native token. \n[C]\n because the token is not inherently linked to the incentivization of agents \nperforming\n a service.\n\n\nWe can also look at some models which do not violate any of these statements. Proof of Work, \nProof of Stake\n, \ndecentralized oracles\n, \nToken Curated Registries\n. Each instance of these mechanisms requires its own unique token to make the crypto-economic incentives align between multiple parties. Defensible tokenization exists at the blockchain protocol level (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and at the blockchain application layer (decentralized oracles, Token Curated Registries).\n\n\nThe key difference is not whether the product is a protocol or an application, but whether the network effect driven by tokenization is defensible or not.\n\n\nHowever, having a defensible token model is not sufficient to maintain a strong \nnetwork effect\n. Token balances can be copied by competitors, software and datasets can be forked, \nhow do you ensure that your token holders are loyal and will continue to prefer your service over that of competitors?\n\n\nLoyalty is everything\n\n\nNetworks are \nanti-rival\n with network effects that push towards \nmonopolistic competition\n, but commoditization driven by decentralization pushes the market towards \nperfect competition\n. Decentralized networks will either be wildly successful, or have minimal value, and the biggest factor is how well the network is able to nurture its network effect.\n\n\nWe can understand this effect from the perspective of an individual participant using \nAlbert Hirchman\u2019s theory\n of \nExit, Voice, and Loyalty\n. The theory says that an individual who perceives a decline in the benefit of remaining within a group may respond by \nExit, leaving the group\n, or \nVoice, by proposing changes that would increase their benefit\n.\n\n\nIn the context of networks built on blockchains the individual may exit by either selling their tokens, or by forking and creating a competitive product.\n\n\nSomeone who is considering quitting Facebook not only has to quit they have to start a new service from scratch without any user accounts or data. Blockchain networks are different, a fork can replicate not just the applications software, but also the state. Now the user can quit and move over to a perfect alternative, and they can more easily convince their friends to switch as well, there is \nsignificantly less friction for exit in the context of blockchain-based networks\n.\n\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there is no friction when exiting, network effects have inertia and most participants prefer to stay on whichever network the majority of their peers support. However, if we acknowledge that the biggest barrier to a fork is the desire to maintain a network effect, \nthan we come to the conclusion that we must maximize Voice of network participants.\n\n\nThe best way to maximize voice is through effective governance.\n\n\nThe Governance Imperative\n\n\nGovernance processes may be formal or informal, on-chain or off-chain, the exact details are less important so long as the process is effective and legitimate enough to maintain loyalty and attract more new network constituents over time.\n\n\nUnion Square Ventures \npointed to governance as the new basis for competion\n nearly ten years ago. Fred Ehrsam\u2019s recent \npost on governance\n suggests that blockchain networks will result in a \nCambrian explosion\n of governance processes. In a tokenized ecosystem that enables rapid experimentation with governance processes, improving our governance processes is imperative. Anything that relies on a governance process today \nmust\n be willing and able to rapidly adopt new processes or risk being left behind by the competition.\n\n\nThe processes that are \u201ceffective and legitimate\u201d enough today may not be as soon as it becomes common knowledge that a better alternative exists.\n\n\nIn some cases our existing structures are complex, emergent, and not well documented and as Vlad Zamfir\u2019s recent post \nagainst moving to on-chain governance\n for Ethereum points out replacing something you don\u2019t fully understand with something you do is not necessarily wise. In other cases we are confident our current processes are problematic and need to be replaced as quickly as possible.\n\n\nDApp developers face the challenge of writing applications that need to be \nfuture-proof\n despite being deployed in an environment still under development. They must decide between immutability and upgradeability. Despite their best efforts bugs may be found in production, and it would be good if fixes could be applied quickly. Even if they choose to write immutable contracts, if users typically access their contracts through a DNS and \nENS\n pointer, then a governance process is needed to manage that change.\n\n\nFor a product to be decentralized, \nit must be impossible for a single individual or small team to unilaterally\n make changes. Current approaches to govern smart-contract upgradeability such as using a multi-sig are highly centralized. Whereas adopting tokenized governance transfers the authority of changes that impact the community to the community itself.\n\n\nDApp developers will likely be the earliest and most successful adopters of tokenized governance models. At first this may simply be a way to \nsecurely update smart contracts\n, but it should expand to more abstract decisions that attract and maintain a community\u2019s network effect both at the application and at the protocol layer.\n\n\nGovernance as a Service (GaaS)\n\n\nGovernance as a Service (GaaS) is a tokenization model where the primary utility of a token is governance over the protocol, application, or network.\n\n\nToken holders are the only party whose interest we can programmatically quantify. Other relevant parties exist, including users, developers, miners, and validators, but their interests in the network are not programatically quantifiable. By entrusting decisions which impact the network to token holders, they become the \nkeepers\n of the network effect. The service they are providing is formal representation of the informal interests of all network participants.\n\n\n\n\nThe model is defensible because \n[A]\n fees can be justified for the service token holders provide (making decisions that ensure the long term sustainability and growth of the network). If token holders do a bad job, or charge excessive fees, the network will fail, but if they do a good job they will be able to adapt to changing market conditions and be more resilient to the effects of commoditization. \n[B]\n Properties like stability are not critical to participating in governance. \n[C]\n Using a unique token is required because it quantifies a users influence in order to align incentivizes to ensure the service provided is consistent.\n\n\nThe value of a governance token accrues relative to the importance of the decisions being made. The more people that use the product and rely on its functionality, the more important critical decisions become, the more value will flow to the governance token.\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nIf you\u2019re building a product that relies on a network effect, creating a governance token or adding governance privileges to your existing token can be incredibly powerful. It increases voice for participants and makes the network effects more resilient.\n\n\nThere are many promising approaches to token based governance including \nquadratic voting\n, \nliquid democracy\n, \nfutarchy\n, and many forms of \nmeritocracy\n that warrant attention.\n\n\nEach process has different strengths and weaknesses, some which are obvious and others which may require experimental implementations to uncover.\n\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what the ideal governance mechanism is, or if there is even an effective one-size-fits all mechanism. It is clear, however, that \nfinding better mechanisms is extremely valuable\n.\n\n\nAt \nAragon\n we are building infrastructure to support these experiments. \naragonOS\n allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and privileges can be set such that more experimental models can be tried in limited capacities at first and gradually given more authority. This will enable us to bring continuous improvement processes from the software world into the realm of economics and social sciences, while maintaining acceptable levels of risk.\n\n\nTo keep up with the progress of\u00a0Aragon:\n\n\n\n\nCome chat with us at the \nAragon Chat\n\n\nFollow Aragon on \nTwitter\n\n\nSubscribe to the \nAragon subreddit\n\n\nFollow Aragon at \nLinkedIn\n\n\nContribute to Aragon at \nGitHub\n\n\nFind us on \nYoutube\n\n\nExplore the \nAragon Wiki",

            "text": "The process of commoditization turns a good or service which is highly differentiated or even unique into a fungible resource, where differences between the commodity offered by sellers in a market are low. Commoditized markets are associated with declining prices and narrow profit margins, as competitors struggle to differentiate their offerings and instead rely on price-based competition.   Hardware :  Ethereum  lets you pay for computation and storage on an as-needed basis by paying gas. Projects like  Golem ,  Storj ,  Truebit , and others aim to further commoditize hardware through decentralized networks. Products that build on these technologies cannot rely on specialized hardware as a key differentiator.  Software : Open source software is commoditized, there is no difference between one instance of public code versus another instance of the same code. Since the only applications that make sense to run on a blockchain are those that benefit from trust-minimization, public source code is the standard.  Data : Decentralized applications rely on publicly available data sources, otherwise there is no way for the public to validate transactions. Privacy technology such as  zk-Snarks  may obscure public visibility, but the encrypted dataset that enables a shared state remains public.   Products or services offered in a market like this will either compete on price, quickly driving profit margins down or seek out new ways to differentiate themselves.  One way to differentiate is to issue a token , even if you don\u2019t otherwise need one. Having a token allows you to create a network effect around your product, people who hold this token will have a vested interest and prefer your product over alternatives. They will be your biggest advocates, they will shill your product to all their friends, who will jump on the band wagon, and do the same to their friends\u2026 and on and on. Or maybe not\u2026  If the market is commoditized and your competitors have at best an equivalent product to yours, issuing a token and requiring it to be used in order to access your product works (sort of like an  API key ). However, by forcing the use of a token when your application doesn\u2019t require one you create a worse user experience because the user\u2019s effective cost is unpredictable. Now if a competitor offers the same product without the restriction, it isn\u2019t equivalent, it is objectively better. Therefore, differentiation in this way may work to some degree, but is not particularly defensible.",

            "text": "In a  defensible token model  you cannot remove the token or replace it with a different token and create a better user experience.  To help reason about the  defensibility  of different tokenization models, identifying a baseline that all defensible token models have in common is helpful:   A : Fees are justified for  services provided . The execution of arbitrary smart-contract code does not justify paying fees in excess of the gas used to validate/mine transactions.  B : It is not defensible to force the usage of a token in such a way that the application would work  equally well or better using a different token . (e.g. a stable coin, or ETH)  C : Tokens which are uniquely  required  to incentivize or disincentivize behavior in order  to provide a service  accrue value relative to that services utility.   If we agree on these statements we can immediately throw out many tokenization strategies. For example  a token whose primary utility is to be the exclusive   medium of exchange  for transactions within a network violates all three of these statements.  [A]  because having to convert to the native token is an  arbitrary fee  unrelated to a service.  [B]  because in a market that requires a medium of exchange, a stable token that  everyone already has  works far better than the application\u2019s native token.  [C]  because the token is not inherently linked to the incentivization of agents  performing  a service.  We can also look at some models which do not violate any of these statements. Proof of Work,  Proof of Stake ,  decentralized oracles ,  Token Curated Registries . Each instance of these mechanisms requires its own unique token to make the crypto-economic incentives align between multiple parties. Defensible tokenization exists at the blockchain protocol level (Proof of Work, Proof of Stake) and at the blockchain application layer (decentralized oracles, Token Curated Registries).

These write-ups will be published as a blog post for the community to review on Monday before Friday\u2019s meeting.\n\n\nBlockchain Is a Decentralized Governance System.\n Blockchain hype is at an all-time high and many people anticipate the first decentralized application to reach the market and gain mass adoption. The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding a decentralised business on Ethereum\n\n\n2018\u200a\u2014\u200aThe DAOs return\n\n\nHow to Make Bonding Curves for Continuous Token Models\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\nDAOs\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nJamie McKane\n on Feb 6\n\n\nAuthor \nCris C.\n on Jan 2\n\n\nAuthor \nSlava Balasanov\n on Feb 6\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthereum, the second-biggest cryptocurrency in the world, has great potential as a platform for autonomous applications.\n It facilitates the transfer of its cryptocurrency, can support decentralised applications, and runs smart contracts. Smart contracts run on its blockchain and are the building blocks for ambitious projects, including games like CryptoKitties. To see what lies ahead for Ethereum, MyBroadband spoke to Ethereum developer Nick Johnson about the implications of decentralised organisations.\n\n\nSince the \u201chack\u201d of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return.\n\n\nWhat are Bonding Curves?\n This is a technical primer on how to make your own bonding curves, followed by a discussion about the opportunities and risks involved.

More specifically, the team aims to build an infrastructure which lets anyone create value without borders or intermediaries. Additionally, they hope to democratize governance in the future, although that will not be easy. Decentralized organizations are an appealing business model, but making sure they work in the real world is something else entirely.\n\n\nSplitting the Foundation from the core devs, and kickstarting funding for other teams to work on Aragon.\n In the tech world, startups usually capitalize by amassing Intellectual Property, data, and governance. They attempt to centralize all this to their own benefit. Most crypto projects that are pursuing decentralization can\u2019t be categorized as startups. Crypto projects usually capitalize by creating a network/protocol/DApp that has a token which should become more valuable as the utility of its network/protocol/DApp grows. To encourage other teams to work on Aragon, we will be splitting off the Foundation to form a company of core developers.\n\n\nPremises, Promises, and Reality.\n There is a massive divide between the promises of cryptocurrency and the use cases they currently support. Most skeptics point out reasonably that there\u2019s little to show regarding real adoption. At the same time, people in industry argue that they need time to finish the infrastructure before they can deliver game changing apps. And the tribalism clouding the topic doesn\u2019t help. There is room for dialogue that would benefit both sides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConspiratus Podcast #1: Protocol Governance with Vlad Zamfir and Arthur Breitman\n\n\nOcean Protocol Technical Whitepaper\n\n\nSaving The Planet: Making It Profitable To Protect The Commons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nEcosystem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nConspiratus\n on Feb 14\n\n\nAuthor \nDon Gossen\n on Feb 20\n\n\nAuthor \nSimon de la Rouviere\n on Feb 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur first full Conspiratus episode where we discuss protocol governance with our two guests, Vlad Zamfir and Arthur Breitman.

Even with regulation from governments there are still externalities that exist that are tough to enforce: eg, global regulation is hard, some commons are out of reach of regulation, some commons regulation could still be abused through corruption \n some externalities are simply never catered for due to the cost in coordination. Instead of trying to force actors to curb the inevitable abuse of a commons, one could instead make it profitable to protect it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Video\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Token Curated Registry Reading List\n\n\nAragon @ ETHDenver Recap\n\n\nLiquid democracy uses blockchain to fix politics, and now you can vote for it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\nAragon\n\n\nGovernance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nToken Curated Registry\n on Feb 22\n\n\nAuthor \nJohn Light\n on Feb 23\n\n\nAuthor \nDanny Crichton\n on Feb 24\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of a list that could eventually become a TCR :)\n\n\nAn incredible weekend of building and bonding with the Denver community.\n This past weekend several members of the Aragon team, including Jorge, Luke, Oliver, and myself (John), attended ETHDenver in Colorado, USA.

The term DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) is no longer esoteric. And hundreds of like-minded teams are building decentralized collaborative social news, insurance and investment platforms, numerous collaboration spaces, and even a couple of decentralized autonomous space agencies.\n\n\nSince the \u201chack\u201d of The DAO, this organizational structure has not been much used, I believe partially because of the reputational damage it caused, and partially due to its intrinsic complexity, especially for those who are not familiar with decentralized governance and/or blockchain. Nevertheless, if 2017 has been the year for ICOs, 2018 may be the year for the DAO return.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead More\n\n\nRead More",

            "text": "Ethereum\u2019s response to EIP0 Results: Governance \n Community\n\n\nWhat values does Ethereum believe in and what is the future the community wants to create?\n\n\n\n\nArt from the Song Dynasty\u200a\u2014\u200aChina\u2019s age of invention\n\n\n// The first few paragraphs is just context, skip down to the next big header for the meat of the article.\n\n\nIt has been three years since the launch of Ethereum and it has taken the center stage of the global tech community. Decisions over the future of Ethereum now reverberate louder than ever and it was a matter of time before we all had to address how we govern ourselves. In April this year, EIP999 was created and the community was once again reminded of the DAO hardfork. Contentious and without finality: Was the DAO hardfork the right decision? Should Parity be allowed to amend the blockchain and recover the funds?\n\n\nIt sparked an awareness and in response to this, \nEIP0\n was born. Held days before the start of EDCON 2018, it was a three day invitational hackathon which looked to discover Ethereum could be better governed. Three days passed and little tangible progress was made. But nonetheless, the important first step was taken. With more questions than answers, we all became aware of the mountain in front of us all.\n\n\nWhat did governance mean and what did it entail?\n\n\nHow were decisions going to be made? And based on what?\n\n\nWhat were the values of Ethereum?\n\n\nWhat values did the community believe in and embody?\n\n\nThese were big questions and required more than a few blog posts to resolve. It required organized effort. Half a month later, Jarred Hope created a \ncommunity survey and gathered 200 responses.\n The looked to diagnose potential problems of Ethereum. It looked to discover the values of ethereum, its moments of greatness but also its flaws. And while some may argue about the sample size of the community and the crudeness of the survey itself, it produced \nvaluable data which we never had access to before.\n\n\nResponses varied between entertaining, funny and outright frustrated. After reading through most of everything, I personally found these two questions the most interesting\u2026\n\n\nIs there anything we \u2018failed\u2019 or are \u2018failing\u2019 at?\n\n\nIs there anything in Ethereum (past/present) that frustrated you, or could have been done better?\n\n\nAnswers to these questions were honest and blunt but also, the data we needed to grow. I was able to organise and map out all the common concerns raised by the responses. Let\u2019s take a look!\n\n\n\n\nIdeas board: \nhttps://www.figma.com/file/I0r0qsykpH459ti94LrVql3q/EIP0-Responses\n\n\nI did a bit of poking around and discovered trends amongst the concerns raised about Ethereum. And while popularity does not necessarily equate to their urgency but nonetheless they are important to address.\n\n\n1. How do we govern Ethereum?\n\n\nWhile not a surprise, governance was on the top of the proverbial list. With nearly over a third of people believing Ethereum to be failing at governance, we had replies about how Ethreum failed to learn from the DAO hardkfork and how there was little clarity and order around the current governance process.\n\n\n\n\n\u201c\u2026the post-parity hack discussions were kind of a mess. Everyone seemed to be talking over each other, rather than at each other. No one seemed to understand each other\u2019s perspectives\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSome called for greater consideration when handling governance. While it is too easy to say \u201cdon\u2019t make it personal\u201d, the matter of fact is that when you are dealing with personal reputation, egos, other peoples money and the core values of others, it becomes a complicated matter. \u201cEmpathy is key\u201d Others believed that our mistakes would come back to haunt us all. Many believed that how events such as the DAO hack and parity hack were handled disappointingly.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe DAO hardfork.

Also, Vitalik introducing the April Fools hardcap \u201cjoke\u201d wasn\u2019t really a great way to introduce such an important discussion. Also, in general, we don\u2019t put enough emphasis on user experience in actually using Ethereum\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discussion thread for EIP999\u200a\u2014\u200aPainting from the Qing Dynasty, Guangxu Period\n\n\nIs this governance a problem? Definitely. Do we have a solution? No. But I think we can do a lot to make the process of finding one smoother. We need to be considerate of the fact that in most governance cases, SOMEONE or a group will need to make a decision or as the CEO of Uber says \u2018the D\u2019. Good calls will be made but so will bad ones. That sourness is inherently unavoidable yet we pretend to live in a world without disappointment. Many times the person you are twitter flaming is just as passionate as the problem as you are and simply wants the best outcome. Instead of the uncontrollable \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019, we should be focusing on making better decisions over time. With so much at stake, it is like Poker. You must play without emotion but with belief and aggression. To be a winning player, you must make the right call at all times without baggage from previous failures or fear of future ones. However in order to do that, we must be led by values and a shared vision. Hard and controversial decisions like EIP999 won\u2019t be the last difficult one that Ethereum has to deal with. And when the darkest hours of the night come, we can still depend on that origin mission that united everyone together in the first place.\n\n\nHypothesis\n\n\nWe all touched upon this at the end of EIP0\u200a\u2014\u200acommunication. While people might comment on disorganization, lack of clarity or criticism of the decisions made, I believe they are underlying symptoms of poor communication. The governance decision making process is opaque and strewn all over the place from twitter threads to obscure wordpress blogs. We need a community recognized stage where all governance related issues are documented and collected.\n\n\nThis is the core of the dilemma. Any work that involves representing the system takes time and effort out of the system it represents. We don\u2019t have a formal way of allocating resources for this. A chicken and the egg problem.\n\n\nWho was in the decision making process? Which group made the final decision? Who supported the decision? Who didn\u2019t? How can Ethereum learn from such decisions in the future? What would determine the success of the decision? What would mean a failure? If either happened, what part of the decision making rationale would need to be reviewed?\n\n\nIf we are able to document those aspects of decisions, we would not only improve the visibility of governance, improve communication but also be able to learn from our ability to govern.\n\n\nBut before we even attempt to solve and improve the communications of Ethereum, we need to establish what that very governance will be led by. What are our values? What does Ethereum stand for? What do we want Ethereum to become? While some people are immutability maximalists, some aren\u2019t. There is a reason for forks. Ethereum needs to decide on what it aims to be and create a united clear vision. I believe that we can worry about all the messy details of ordering EIPs and decentralising control after there is an established vision. Everything else will follow. Only then can we then move with rigor and make decisions with full conviction.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cCommunication. We need to bridge the gaps in communication. However, it is hard if we don\u2019t even agree on what are our shared values.\u201c\n\n\n\n\nJames Hancock mentioned how that politics 50 years ago is not politics today, politics 50 years ago will not be the same as today. Locking ourselves into a set of ideals now, not only has its worries, it is impossible to know what the belief systems of the future will be. We are ever evolving groups that change and grow over time.\n\n\nGoing forward action items:\n\n\n\n\nWhat does Ethereum want to be? What is its vision? What values does Ethereum embody? What the boundaries of Ethereum?\u200a\u2014\u200a\nStart writing and releasing manifestos written by teams or individuals?\n\n\nWe need better communication of problems along with greater visibility and clarity behind the governance rationale\u200a\u2014\u200a\nEstablish a central stage where all aspects of governance can be documented?\n\n\nWe need full time focus on governance. They need to be the right people and I don\u2019t mean people with credentials. They need to be people who truly care about Ethereum and people you believe and trust in\u200a\u2014\u200a\nFund individuals to figure out governance.\n \u201cEthereum wide product managers who present problems and facilitate problem solving\u201d (Sounds similar to politicians? eh.)\n\n\n\n\n2. What is the Ethereum Foundation?\n\n\nUnlike concerns about the governance of issues like EIP999, there was a wide angle of issues directed towards the Ethereum Foundation (EF). Responses had concerns over the direction of funding. How much, when and who. Is funding going to the right places? How is funding decided upon? Who is it decided by? Who controls the EF? Who works for the EF? How is the organisation structured? How can others participate in the governance of the Ethereum Foundation? Sounds like a lot of ambiguity!\n\n\nLet\u2019s take a look at the Ethereum Foundation\u2019s mission on their website\u2026\n\n\n\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation\u2019s mission is to promote and support Ethereum platform and base layer research, development and education to bring decentralized protocols and tools to the world that empower developers to produce next generation decentralized applications (dapps), and together build a more globally accessible, more free and more trustworthy Internet.\n\n\n\n\nWhat other functions is it involved in? How does it stay impartial? Where does the influence of the EF start and end?\n\n\nThe Ethereum foundation holds a lot of centralized weight, influence and financial ability in the Ethereum space and thus why we should all be concerned with its conduct. Whether it is good or not, they hold responsibility on the same level as state nations in maintaining and funding public goods.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cits a trap\u201d\u200a\u2014\u200aquote from the General Ackbar, a song dynasty commander\n\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always felt that the Ethereum Foundation could\u2019ve fostered a more radical approach: radical transparency \n more radical openness\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhile not \u201cfailing,\u201d I feel that the Ethereum Foundation needs to become increasingly decentralized and transparent. This could take the form of adding more contributors, more articles about what is being worked on, and so on. We want to avoid the perception that decisions and meaningful work is happening in the proverbial smoke-filled room\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWhat is going on with the EF vs Ethereum Research? Why isn\u2019t tons of money being directed by those orgs (does only one have money?) into real core development? The grant program is a start but needs 10x and better coordination / visibility\u201d\n\n\n\n\nHypothesis\n\n\nAgain I think the wide range of concerns surrounding the Foundation can be solved with clearer clarification of what the Ethereum Foundation is and what it is not. Unless better ongoing communication happens, there will always be a blurred sense of ambiguity. This then can potentially distort the weight of its power in areas in which it should not involve itself in.\n\n\nIn terms of transparency of operations, this is likely to have been a highly discussed topic within the organisation and the current situation is likely to be where it is for a good reason. I personally believe that with so much weight in the community, it should operate with absolute transparency. I give massive props to the transparency of Aragon\u2019s quarterly reports (salaries, expenses, auditing costs, bounties etc.) where the financials are published out into the open. I also suggest looking at how the Zcash Foundation conducts grant funding\u200a\u2014\u200aeverything is organized in github issues where dialogue is open to the public. Rejections and accepted grant applications are all visible. I really appreciate that and hope Ethereum could move toward something similar.\n\n\nThere were other problems addressed such as impartiality and issues over the potential political centralization of the Ethereum but I think if we care about them, then they will show through our values. And if we are led by our values then it will be fought for.\n\n\nGoing forward action items:\n\n\n\n\nWhat is Ethereum Foundation\u2019s specific function within the community? What is it involved with? Events, grants or even media? Where do the responsibilities start and end?\u200a\u2014\u200a\nClarify\n\n\nImplement transparency\u200a\u2014\u200a\nAs discussed\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nI think these suggestions could provide for a first step and serve well as the start of discourse threads.

Art from the Song Dynasty\u200a\u2014\u200aChina\u2019s age of invention  // The first few paragraphs is just context, skip down to the next big header for the meat of the article.  It has been three years since the launch of Ethereum and it has taken the center stage of the global tech community. Decisions over the future of Ethereum now reverberate louder than ever and it was a matter of time before we all had to address how we govern ourselves. In April this year, EIP999 was created and the community was once again reminded of the DAO hardfork. Contentious and without finality: Was the DAO hardfork the right decision? Should Parity be allowed to amend the blockchain and recover the funds?  It sparked an awareness and in response to this,  EIP0  was born. Held days before the start of EDCON 2018, it was a three day invitational hackathon which looked to discover Ethereum could be better governed. Three days passed and little tangible progress was made. But nonetheless, the important first step was taken. With more questions than answers, we all became aware of the mountain in front of us all.  What did governance mean and what did it entail?  How were decisions going to be made? And based on what?  What were the values of Ethereum?  What values did the community believe in and embody?  These were big questions and required more than a few blog posts to resolve. It required organized effort. Half a month later, Jarred Hope created a  community survey and gathered 200 responses.  The looked to diagnose potential problems of Ethereum. It looked to discover the values of ethereum, its moments of greatness but also its flaws. And while some may argue about the sample size of the community and the crudeness of the survey itself, it produced  valuable data which we never had access to before.  Responses varied between entertaining, funny and outright frustrated. After reading through most of everything, I personally found these two questions the most interesting\u2026  Is there anything we \u2018failed\u2019 or are \u2018failing\u2019 at?  Is there anything in Ethereum (past/present) that frustrated you, or could have been done better?  Answers to these questions were honest and blunt but also, the data we needed to grow. I was able to organise and map out all the common concerns raised by the responses. Let\u2019s take a look!   Ideas board:  https://www.figma.com/file/I0r0qsykpH459ti94LrVql3q/EIP0-Responses  I did a bit of poking around and discovered trends amongst the concerns raised about Ethereum. And while popularity does not necessarily equate to their urgency but nonetheless they are important to address.",

            "text": "Governance Through Code\n\n\n\n\nThe biggest evolution in governance since the invention of the company\n\n\n\n\nAuthor \nThijs Maas / @ThijsMaasLaw\n\n\nThroughout time governance has been the single most important tool for us, homo sapiens, to thrive. Our capability to form complex governance structures made us distinguish ourselves from other animals. More recently governance structures have become solidified in systems of bureaucracy and business hierarchies. Governance truly is the glue that holds together human societies and it is therefore still our most important tool. With the rise of the internet and advances in cryptography, online communities and new forms of governance are increasingly emerging. In fact, governance through code is the single largest innovation in the field of governance since the company. Yet, new advances made in this area barely get the attention they deserve.\n\n\nTribal Governance\n\n\nFirst however, let us go back in time. Back to our forefathers, of which there were no more than 10.000 on the face of the entire planet. Back to a time where we weren\u2019t the only type of humans around. Yes, you read that right: 70.000 years ago, there were multiple species of intellectually evolved monkeys walking the face of the earth.\n\n\nWe, the homo sapiens, were only one of many. Contrary to popular belief, other human species, such as the homo \nsoloensis\n, the homo \ndenisova\n and the \nneanderthals\n had evolved separately from homo sapiens. Yet, about 30.000 years ago they had all vanished from the planet. Scholars increasingly agree that there is a good possibility that we, homo sapiens, have eradicated them all.\n\n\nThis raises questions. How? Why us? What had made homo sapiens capable of wiping out all these\nspecies? How come we are here to ponder these questions, instead of the far stronger neanderthals, who had also evolved cognitively?\n\n\nThe answer lies in governance.\n\n\nWe, homo sapiens, are\ninherently territorial. To ensure survival, we organized in tribes which worked\ntogether to hunt and gather. As a tribe, having control over one's own\nterritory for hunting and gathering was advantageous, so we would fight with\nothers over fertile lands. Of course, we did not actually 'own' territories as\nmany other animals made more use of it than us. However, the sense of\nterritorial ownership gave us common goals and allowed us to organize ourselves\nto pursue them.\n\n\nLiving in tribes in\norder to pursue our territorial interests has allowed us to govern ourselves\neffectively. Most species of the homo family were not capable of maintaining a\ntribe larger than about 50 individuals. When a tribe grew in size, members would\ngenerally fight amongst themselves or split up. Not homo sapiens though.\nResearch indicates that our better-developed communicative skills allowed us to\nform groups of up to 150 individuals. The most important aspect of our communication,\nwas that we were able to talk about others behind their backs effectively.\nAlthough seemingly trivial, this allowed us to form complex social relations,\nwhich helped the tribe understand the established hierarchy. As such, our\ngovernance was better than the governance in tribes of other cognitively\ndeveloped human-like species.\n\n\nReligion and Law-Based Governance\n\n\nAs time progressed we became increasingly skilled in organizing ourselves. Throughout the cognitive revolution we learned to communicate about things that we had never seen, heard or smelled. As our language evolved, we gained the ability to communicate about myths in all shapes or forms. We started talking about our superstitions and, over time, a wide variety of religions emerged. Of course, these did not exist anywhere but in our minds. Just like our ideas of territorial ownership, they were solely social constructs. However, these early religions helped us to further develop an understanding about what is good and bad behavior - not just towards the gods but also towards each other. For example, killing a member of your own tribe near the river is bad and it might piss of a water spirit. As such, others in the tribe would punish you for it. This decision mechanism to punish a killer is an early form of governance based on natural law. The decision to punish was not made out of impulse or because the alpha male dictated it, but the killer violated a common understanding about how the community was to behave. As such, belief in a religious myth helped communities to govern itself more effectively \u2013 and grow as a result.\n\n\nWe fast forward through time, as religious myths kept forming the glue to allow us to function as a society for most of history. Over the span of history, our religious beliefs has allowed us to form increasingly complex legal systems based on natural law. These systems allowed us to form more stable societies and as law dictated what behavior was accepted, people could be appointed to enforce it. Just like religion and territorial beliefs, our notion of law is a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist anywhere but in our minds. Once again however, this social construct allowed us to better govern ourselves. It worked so well, that as civilization grew increasingly complex, we started codifying our legal beliefs, first in ancient Egypt and later in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Not coincidentally, this went hand in hand with the codification of organizational structures. Our governance became codified law.\n\n\nStill, we did remain territorial. Territorial conquest and commonalities between local tribes led to increasingly bigger communities and finally even nation-states and empires, which were sustainable due to our newly found belief in codified governance. Although better organized, we would still focus on the same kind of territorial conquest that tribes had pursued. Complete empires emerged, with effective systems of delegation of power. Territorial beliefs gave people a common sense of union with other citizens of an empire. Today, we call such beliefs nationalism.\n\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\nFrom the 16th century onwards, nationalism increasingly became a problem. By now, we realized that there was substantial money to be made in global trade, and we had started colonizing most of the known world to capitalize on it. However, colonial rebellions based on nationalist beliefs and complex diplomatic relations between colonizers made it increasingly difficult for states to trade effectively. Realizing these restraints on the nations\u2019 trade, daring traders came up with a new form of governance to capitalize on the opportunity at hand. In 1602, Dutch East India Company was established. It marked the beginning of a new era of governance. In essence, we had managed to make up a new social construct to allow us to govern ourselves effectively: the publicly traded company.\n\n\nThis new construct, rooted in our system of codified legal beliefs, allowed us to imagine a new \u2018entity\u2019 that would exist separately from its earthly assets, owners and employees. Each of the three can be replaced and the legal entity will continue to exist. Like an imagined deity, concept of state, money or legal system, this entity exists in our minds only. In Sapiens, Yuval Noah Harari illustrates this beautifully:\n\n\nPeople easily understand that primitives cement their social order by believing in sorcerers, ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Modern Business-people and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers.[\u2026] If a priest goes through all the required spells and oaths, exclaims \u2018Hoc est corpus meum!\u2019, then hocus popus -  bread is turned into Christ\u2019s flesh. In the same fashion, when a lawyer goes through all the required spells and oaths, using a nicely decorated piece of paper, affixing his ornate signature to a piece of paper, then hocus pocus, a company is created.\n\n\nToday, governance through the concept of big multinational companies has arguably become more powerful than territorial or religious governance. In fact, in the past 400 years, shareholder-value maximizing companies have led to more technological achievement and welfare than ever before. The revenue of the biggest corporations now dwarfs the GDP of most states. So how has this new kind of organization become so important?\n\n\nSimply said, corporate governance unites people on the basis of one very strong common interest: making money. Ever since people in the developed world don\u2019t have to focus on survival, they have focused on accruing as much money as possible. Money, together with status, is what drives us, and companies are effective because all stakeholders in a company are united by having a financial interest in the success of the company. Over time, we started figuring out the best way to be governed within a company, and so, the field of corporate governance emerged. This field is occupied with patterns of rule within businesses \u2013 with the systems, institutions and norms by which businesses are directed and controlled.\n\n\nCode-Based Governance\n\n\nNow, a new form of governance is appearing. This new form of organizing ourselves has been made possible by a great human achievement: the creation of the internet. This worldwide communication system has led to radical changes in our daily lives. For the first time, people all around the world are able to communicate with each other instantly. This communication is allowing us to form new communities. These communities are not very different from early tribes, albeit they are not based on territorial beliefs or religious myths. Instead, they have organically emerged around shared commonalities and interests between people all over the world. On Reddit alone, you can find over 1.2 million of these communities. Community governance is implemented through voting systems and moderation, based on shared beliefs on the kind of content and behavior that is to be allowed in the subforum. Communities are increasingly distinctive from each other due to distinctive uses of language and memes that are specific to the forum. What\u2019s more, we are even starting to see rivalries between these communities; a form of new-age tribalism.\n\n\nOne of the more important tribes was organized around an electronic mailing since the late 1980s. Going by the name of \u2018cypherpunks\u2019, a group of individuals with shared beliefs about the importance of cryptography and privacy-enhancing technologies continuously explored a number of technical, cryptographic concepts. Many of these concepts would later form the basis for a new myth to believe in. This myth would be the feasibility of an existence completely separate from today\u2019s social constructs such as the state, banks and corporations. It was named Bitcoin.\n\n\nMany rejected the idea instantly as a surreal daydream of magical internet money created out of thin air. However, Bitcoin kept being developed by a community of online developers with similar beliefs about the faults of our current monetary system and the ability of central banks - the most powerful corporations in the world - to print money on its own discretion. Their solution, an online currency with a fixed-supply, is extremely elegantly designed. Bitcoin\u2019s community exists of users, investors, miners (the parties that make sure the system is safe), developers and nodes (the parties that basically keep miners in check). None of these parties actually have to know each other to add value to the community. Instead, they only have to believe in the newly found social construct called Bitcoin, and its underlying code.\n\n\nBitcoin\u2019s governance resembles the governance of governmental systems. In a blogpost, titled \u2018Blockchain Governance: Programming Our Future\u2019, Fred Ehrsam illustrates this beautifully:\n\n\n\u201cSimilar to the Senate submitting new bills, developers submit pull requests. Similar to the judiciary, miners decide whether or not to actually adopt the laws in practice. Similar to the executive branch, the nodes of the network can veto by not running a version which aligns with what the miners are running. And similar to citizens, the users can revolt. Finally, economic incentives dictate that it is in everyone\u2019s best interest to maintain trust in the system. For example: if miners alienated all the users, the tokens would decrease in value and they would go out of business.\u201c\n\n\nBitcoin has shown that governance through code, combined with a religious belief in a common interest, seems to be a viable way for humans to organize themselves. Bitcoins, and other cryptographic tokens, create network effects and align interests between stakeholders within the ecosystem. Everyone who owns bitcoin has an incentive to contribute value to the project, by for example, preaching its benefits to the outside world.\n\n\nAdditional financial incentives can be encoded in a currency\u2019s codebase to encourage specific behavior. For example, projects like Golem and Filecoin award people for renting out their computer\u2019s storage capacity. By effective application of game theory and, more specifically, mechanism design, such financial incentives can be further fine-tuned. Meanwhile, reliable voting mechanisms can be implemented using blockchains, by having cryptocurrency holders \u2018stake\u2019 their tokens in order to signal their vote about specific topics. Implementations hereof are found in the governance of projects like Decred and Augur. In Decred, this voting mechanism is pretty straight-forward. Augur on the other hand is a prediction market which allows people to stake money on expected outcomes of events. If you are right, you are rewarded in tokens and if you\u2019re wrong you are punished, which essentially creates a market for the predictions on the future.\n\n\nThis has all led to a renewed interest in how we can effectively govern ourselves in a digital age. Increasingly, forms of governance such as liquid democracy, quadratic voting, futarchy and meritocracy are re-examined.  At the same time, a new kind of organization is emerging: the decentralized autonomous organization, or DAO. It is an organization that is run through the rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts. The first, and most well-known DAO was, not coincidentally called The DAO. It was coded to function as an investment fund, which allowed all who bought its tokens to vote on how the funds should invest its money. As most are aware, The DAO was a gigantic failure. It had loopholes in its code, which resulted in it being hacked almost immediately. Sadly, this has had a significant negative impact in the online blockchain communities\u2019 interest in DAOs.\n\n\nSo, what\u2019s the point of this article?\n\n\nOnly by understanding that effective governance has historically been the most important factor of human survival, evolution and progress, we can appreciate the opportunities that are found in the concept of governance through code. Only by understanding our history we can understand its significance for our future. Realizing all this, it is essential that we keep experimenting with code-based governance. This is exactly the reason why I applaud Aragon, a project that is building the infrastructure to support these experiments. Aragon\u2019s platform allows for governance applications to be built and shared between organizations, and experimental forms of governance to be tested and gradually implemented to ensure safety. The aim is for new kinds of organizations to exist outside of the conventional, territorial, legal systems of today. To make this possible, the project is even building its own digital jurisdiction, complete with a decentralized arbitration system. In case of a dispute about the (mal)functioning of a DAO\u2019s code, a number of jurors will be randomly chosen to vote on how the dispute should be resolved. They are incentivized to act in an honest and rational manner: if their vote coincides with the vote of the majority of jurors, they are rewarded in; if not, they are punished.\n\n\nIt is time for us to accept that blockchain-projects are more than just magical internet money. They are experiments in what could prove to be the greatest evolution in human governance since the invention of the company.",

Back to a time where we weren\u2019t the only type of humans around. Yes, you read that right: 70.000 years ago, there were multiple species of intellectually evolved monkeys walking the face of the earth.  We, the homo sapiens, were only one of many. Contrary to popular belief, other human species, such as the homo  soloensis , the homo  denisova  and the  neanderthals  had evolved separately from homo sapiens. Yet, about 30.000 years ago they had all vanished from the planet. Scholars increasingly agree that there is a good possibility that we, homo sapiens, have eradicated them all.  This raises questions. How? Why us? What had made homo sapiens capable of wiping out all these\nspecies? How come we are here to ponder these questions, instead of the far stronger neanderthals, who had also evolved cognitively?  The answer lies in governance.  We, homo sapiens, are\ninherently territorial. To ensure survival, we organized in tribes which worked\ntogether to hunt and gather. As a tribe, having control over one's own\nterritory for hunting and gathering was advantageous, so we would fight with\nothers over fertile lands. Of course, we did not actually 'own' territories as\nmany other animals made more use of it than us. However, the sense of\nterritorial ownership gave us common goals and allowed us to organize ourselves\nto pursue them.  Living in tribes in\norder to pursue our territorial interests has allowed us to govern ourselves\neffectively. Most species of the homo family were not capable of maintaining a\ntribe larger than about 50 individuals. When a tribe grew in size, members would\ngenerally fight amongst themselves or split up. Not homo sapiens though.\nResearch indicates that our better-developed communicative skills allowed us to\nform groups of up to 150 individuals. The most important aspect of our communication,\nwas that we were able to talk about others behind their backs effectively.\nAlthough seemingly trivial, this allowed us to form complex social relations,\nwhich helped the tribe understand the established hierarchy. As such, our\ngovernance was better than the governance in tribes of other cognitively\ndeveloped human-like species.",

            "text": "As time progressed we became increasingly skilled in organizing ourselves. Throughout the cognitive revolution we learned to communicate about things that we had never seen, heard or smelled. As our language evolved, we gained the ability to communicate about myths in all shapes or forms. We started talking about our superstitions and, over time, a wide variety of religions emerged. Of course, these did not exist anywhere but in our minds. Just like our ideas of territorial ownership, they were solely social constructs. However, these early religions helped us to further develop an understanding about what is good and bad behavior - not just towards the gods but also towards each other. For example, killing a member of your own tribe near the river is bad and it might piss of a water spirit. As such, others in the tribe would punish you for it. This decision mechanism to punish a killer is an early form of governance based on natural law. The decision to punish was not made out of impulse or because the alpha male dictated it, but the killer violated a common understanding about how the community was to behave. As such, belief in a religious myth helped communities to govern itself more effectively \u2013 and grow as a result.  We fast forward through time, as religious myths kept forming the glue to allow us to function as a society for most of history. Over the span of history, our religious beliefs has allowed us to form increasingly complex legal systems based on natural law. These systems allowed us to form more stable societies and as law dictated what behavior was accepted, people could be appointed to enforce it. Just like religion and territorial beliefs, our notion of law is a social construct. It doesn\u2019t exist anywhere but in our minds. Once again however, this social construct allowed us to better govern ourselves. It worked so well, that as civilization grew increasingly complex, we started codifying our legal beliefs, first in ancient Egypt and later in ancient Greece and the Roman Empire. Not coincidentally, this went hand in hand with the codification of organizational structures. Our governance became codified law.  Still, we did remain territorial. Territorial conquest and commonalities between local tribes led to increasingly bigger communities and finally even nation-states and empires, which were sustainable due to our newly found belief in codified governance. Although better organized, we would still focus on the same kind of territorial conquest that tribes had pursued. Complete empires emerged, with effective systems of delegation of power. Territorial beliefs gave people a common sense of union with other citizens of an empire. Today, we call such beliefs nationalism.",

If you have a clear governance process, you can pull talent from wherever it resides, and avoid painful arguments that leave nothing more than people screaming at each other over a mailing list.  There are multiple projects besides Aragon trying to define new ways of Governance that can endure.  Decred , for example, aims to solve the problems that Bitcoin has in its governance by implementing a consensus voting model that empowers stakeholders and allows for the seamless transition from one set of rules to another. This makes the project move at a faster pace than Bitcoin since all stakeholders incentives are aligned with the development of the project itself.\nGovernance issues have plagued Bitcoin with multiple forks, community splits, and inability to move forward on certain  Bitcoin Improvement Proposals .  Aragon takes governance one step further, by not just allowing voting, but providing a platform to implement whole digital jurisdictions.\nThe value of this can't be underestimated, a digital jurisdiction enables all participants to know the rules and automatically (via smart contracts) incentivizes good behavior by rewarding it, while punishing lechers or people trying to harm the organization. It also\ncompletely erases the problem with incompatible jurisdictions, since you are now playing by the rules set by a group of people that have similar goals, and we all know 2 heads (or a million) are better than 1!
